        <h2>What is Live Virtual Class:</h2> 
        A virtual classroom is an online learning environment that allows for live interaction between the tutor and the learners as they are participating in learning activities.
        In other words, the virtual classroom is a shared online space where the learners and the tutor work together simultaneously. 
        Usually, these interactions take place through videoconferencing. 
        The participants have tools to present learning content in different formats, as well as to implement collaborative and individual activities. 
        In this type of interaction, the teacher has the particularly important role of the moderator who guides the learning process and supports group activities and discussions.

            In higher education in Canada, Nigeria and the United States, a course is a unit of teaching that typically lasts one academic term, is led by one or more instructors (teachers or professors), and has a fixed roster of students. A course is usually an individual subject. Students may receive a grade and academic credit after completion of the course.[1]
            In India, United Kingdom, Australia and Singapore, as well as parts of Canada, a course is the entire programme of studies required to complete a university degree, and the word "unit" or "module" would be used to refer to an academic course as it is referred to in other parts of the world, for example North America and the rest of Europe.
            In between the two, in South Africa, a course officially is the collection of all courses (in the American sense, these are often called "modules") over a year or semester, though the American usage is common. In the Philippines, a course can be an individual subject (usually referred to by faculty and school officials) or the entire programme (usually referred to by students and outsiders).
            Courses are time-limited in most universities worldwide, lasting anywhere between several weeks to several semesters. They can either be compulsory material or "elective". An elective is usually not a required course, but there are a certain number of non-specific electives that are required for certain majors.

        <p>    The Environments (L, V, & C) by themselves are generally well understood and apply universally to a diverse range of disciplines such as the medical field, law enforcement or operational military applications. 
            Using the medical field as an example, the Live Environment can be a doctor performing CPR on a human patient in a critical real world situation. In this same context, the Virtual Environment would include a doctor practicing CPR on a training mannequin,
            and the Constructive Environment is the software within the training mannequin that drives its behavior. In a second example, consider fighter pilot training or operational testing.
            Therefore, the words that describe specifically how future training or operational testing will be accomplished require standardization as well. This is best described by backing away from technical terminology and thinking about how human beings actually prepare for their specific combat responsibilities.
             In practice, human beings prepare for their roles in one of three Constructs: Live (with actual combat tools), in a Simulator of some kind, or in other Ancillary ways (tests, academics, computer-based training, etc.). </p>
